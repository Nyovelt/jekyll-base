# Chapter 1: Basic Concepts

## 1.1 Introduction

We commence our study by defining some basic concepts. These concepts include charge, current, voltage, circuit elements, power, and energy.

## 1.2 System of units

## 1.3 Charge and Current

**Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in coulombs (C).**

- According to experimental observations, the only charges that occur in nature are integral multiples of the electronic charge e = −1.602 × 10e−19 C.

- The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Thus, the algebraic sum of the electric charges in a system does not change.

**Electric current is the time rate of change of charge, measured in amperes (A).**

**1 ampere = 1 coulomb/second**
